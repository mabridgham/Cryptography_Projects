# Cryptography_Projects

The goal of this project is to eventually combine a collection of small python cryptography programs together to make one larger command
line tool that people can use for all of their cryptography needs and entertainment.

Collection of open source Cryptography python projects that I am currently working on. All source code programs were
obtained and modified from the sources below, as well as any .txt files that are included. Also, some of the 
programs require the use of secondary programs called pyperclip.py, wordPatterns.py and makeWordPatterns.py
in order to run but they are not mine and not ones that I am working on. They were obtained from the sources below,
specifically from crackingcodes. I will be uploading them for convenience for now until I can figure out how to 
integrate them into the programs I have so they no longer need them separately.

A note on running these programs:
You need the latest version of Python to run them. Also if it requires another program or .txt file, they all must
be in the same folder to run properly.
