# Cryptography_Projects

Collection of open source Cryptography python projects that I am currently working on. All source code was
obtained and modified from the sources below, as well as any .txt files that are included. Also, some of the 
programs require the use of a secondary program called pyperclip.py in order to run but it is not mine and
not one that I am working on. It was all obtained from the sources below, specifically from crackingcodes.
I will be uploading it for convenience for now until I can figure out how to integrate it into the programs 
I have so they no longer need it.
